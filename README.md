- Ran **Accessibility Scanner** to identify and address issues, such as adjusting text contrast.

## Testing and Stress-Testing

- Adopted a test-driven approach, writing and running test cases during each development step.
- Conducted instrumented/UI tests regularly, addressing edge cases and ensuring app stability.


## Time Investment

- **Writing Code, Testing, and Solving Accessibility Issues:** 14 hours
- **Documentation:** 1 hour
- **Total Time:** 15 hours

## Assignment Difficulty

On a scale of 1 to 10, the assignment's difficulty is rated as **9**. The challenging aspects included database management and navigation handling using the nav graph, providing valuable insights into crucial functionalities in app development.
